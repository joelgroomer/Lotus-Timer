## Project Overview

Follow along with this project's progress on my blog at <https://dev.to/julltron/lotus-timer-the-beginning-41i5>


### Mission

Give users a simple yet highly customizable way to define meditation routines to suit their own needs.


### Objectives

1. Simplicity.
  * I want this app to be feature-rich but also dead simple. Minimal annoyances.
    Controls should be large and easy to use with intuitive gestures.
2. Customization.
  * Users should be able to determine as many aspects of their meditation session as possible. Limits should be kept to a minimum. The app should be able to adapt itself to whatever meditation or other spiritual practice/mental discipline the user wants to use it for.
  * Users will be able to save as many different sessions as they'd like so that they can quickly choose the one that fits their needs when they open the app on any given day.
3. Cross-platform.
  * Saved sessions sync across devices.
  * Will definitely target iPhone, iPad, and Apple Watch.
  * Apple TV and macOS are secondary considerations.
4. Multi-media.
  * Segments can utilize audio and visuals.
  * Music.
  * Pre-recorded audio clips. This is where guided meditations can come in. Users can record themselves (or someone else) reading a guided meditation and play it back during a session, or import from an audio file.
  * Text can be added for display or scrolling playback. This allows the user to add prayers, chants, sacred texts for recitation or contemplation, etc.
  * Anything recorded should be exportable.
5. Sharable.
  * Routines can be shared with other users. I can see two possible ways for this to work.
  * Direct sharing between people who know each other.
  * A limited social aspect to the app that allows for sharing more broadly.
  * This should include recordings created by the user.
6. Accessible.
  * The app should follow accessibility guidelines as much as possible.

### Requirements

-   iOS 14.0+
-   Xcode 12.0+
